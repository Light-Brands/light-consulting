## Executive Summary

This document outlines the market landscape for AI consulting in 2025-2026, analyzes our current 4-funnel system, and presents a comprehensive list of new funnel opportunities that could round out our offerings to capture maximum market demand.

The AI consulting market is projected to grow from $11.13B (2025) to $116.8B (2035) at 26.49% CAGR. The opportunity is massive, but so is the gap between what businesses need and what they're getting.

## Part 1: Current Funnel Analysis

### Our Existing 4 Funnels

| Funnel | Name | Purpose | Target |
|--------|------|---------|--------|
| 1 | **AI Readiness Diagnostic** | Entry qualification | Founders with traction seeking clarity |
| 2 | **Foundation Shift (Web2 → AI-Native)** | Deep transformation | Companies ready to rebuild foundation |
| 3 | **AI Intelligent System** | Systematic intelligence | Businesses beyond website tactics |
| 4 | **AI Intelligence Ascension** | Full client journey | Committed leaders wanting full system |

### What Our Funnels Do Well
- **Qualification-focused**: Strong filtering for ideal clients
- **Clarity-first positioning**: Sell clarity, not commitment
- **Systems thinking**: Differentiated from tool-collectors
- **Trust-based ascension**: Clear path from diagnostic to partnership
- **High-value transformation**: Enterprise-level thinking

### Current Gaps in Our Funnel Portfolio
1. **No mid-market entry point** (between free diagnostic and full transformation)
2. **No specialized industry funnels** (vertical-specific pain points)
3. **No team/workforce enablement offers** (upskilling is huge demand)
4. **No governance/compliance path** (regulatory pressure mounting)
5. **No ongoing relationship model** outside Architect Partnership
6. **No quick-win tactical offers** to warm up cold leads

### What High Performers Do Differently (Top 6%)
