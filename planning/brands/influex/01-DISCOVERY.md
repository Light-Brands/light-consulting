## Company Background

### Founding Story

Dmitriy Kozlov launched Influex after running a creative design agency. High-profile clients noticed his work and began requesting the "template" — which sparked a realization: most personal brand websites underperform. He envisioned reimagining these sites as "marketing savvy and artistically rich," combining strategic direction with exceptional design to help leaders express their authentic selves while driving measurable results.

### Company Timeline

- **2017**: Influex founded
- **Present**: 200+ websites delivered for thought leaders
- **Costs**: ~$100K/month WordPress infrastructure and operations
- **Margins**: Barely profitable—revenue just above costs most months
- **Future**: AI-powered brand development platform (the path to real margins)

- Design-first differentiation
- Values-aligned approach ("conscious branding")
- Thought leader focus (not general SMB)

### Unique Methodology

2. Essence-first over formula-based
3. Client as hero, not brand as hero
4. Multi-dimensional branding (personal + business complexity)

---

## Opportunity Assessment

### Strengths to Leverage
- Exceptional design capabilities and methodology
- Strong client relationships (200+ premium brands)
- Clear brand philosophy ("Essence-First")
- Proven ability to serve high-profile clients
- Premium market positioning and reputation

### Gaps to Address
- WordPress consuming all the margin
- $100K/month in costs with thin profitability
- Manual development creating scaling ceiling
- No self-service client capabilities
- Fragmented tool ecosystem (200+ separate codebases)
- Every new client adds complexity, not leverage

### Transformation Potential
- **Critical**: Current model is unsustainable at scale
- **Alignment**: Design-first values match our approach perfectly
- **Upside**: Moving from ~break-even to 60-80% margins possible
- **Scale**: Same team could serve 10x clients with right platform
