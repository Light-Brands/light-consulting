## The Missouri Recall Controversy

### The Practice
Sparks extracted a small amount of THC from Missouri-grown, state-regulated marijuana, then mixed it with large quantities of hemp-derived THC-A oil purchased from out-of-state suppliers (including Florida). The hemp-derived THC was:
- Unregulated
- Significantly cheaper than Missouri-grown marijuana
- Converted to Delta-9 THC through heating (decarboxylation)
- Sold to consumers at full marijuana prices

### Sourcing Issues
- Sparks could not recall where he purchased the hemp oil
- Paid suppliers in cash or traded extraction services
- Relied on verbal agreements without documentation
- No records kept of THC-A oil origins
- "Common practice in the industry," per Sparks' testimony

### Workforce Practices
- Sparks, Tania Conte, and Conte employees drove up from Oklahoma on weekends
- Up to 20 temporary workers brought in from St. Louis area
- Workers paid in cash
- Neither Sparks nor Tania Conte could identify workers by name
- Commission noted this as part of "lax compliance culture"

### Timeline
- **January 2021:** Sparks starts SND Equipment Leasing in Missouri
- **September 2021:** Conte products debut through Heya
- **December 2021:** Conte breaks relationship with Heya; Delta recruits Sparks
- **March 2022:** Delta-Sparks partnership begins
- **August 2022:** Sparks applies for Missouri agent ID; denied due to felony
- **June 2023:** Sparks obtains agent ID during fingerprint moratorium
- **Spring 2023:** Low distillate supply; Sparks produces large volumes for Delta to sell to 100+ manufacturers
- **August 4, 2023:** State officials visit Delta requesting security footage
- **August 7, 2023:** Burglary at Delta; servers stolen (timing suspicious to investigators)
- **August 2023:** 60,000+ products recalled
- **November/December 2023:** Delta's license revoked
- **March 2024:** Three-day Administrative Hearing Commission appeal; Sparks provides 8 hours of testimony
- **March 2024:** Sparks' agent ID revoked
- **February 2025:** Delta loses appeal; Commission cites "corporate culture of lax compliance"
- **April 2025:** Additional 6,000 products added to recall list

### Legal Findings (February 2025)
Commissioner Carole Iles issued 137-page ruling:
- "Non-compliance was intentional"
- THC-A becomes intoxicating same way regardless of hemp or marijuana origin
- THC-A from out-of-state is prohibited in Missouri marijuana products
- Delta had "corporate culture of lax compliance with regulatory requirements"

---

## Legal Status

### Agent ID History
- **August 2022:** Applied for Missouri agent ID with Delta employment offer
- **August 2022:** Application denied due to disqualifying felony conviction
- **June 2023:** Issued agent ID due to moratorium on FBI background checks (following recreational marijuana legalization in December 2022)
- **March 2024:** Agent ID revoked (one of four contractors affected)

### Ongoing Litigation

**SND Equipment Leasing v. Delta Extraction (Franklin County Circuit Court)**
- **Filed:** June/July 2024
- **Claims:**
  - $13 million for unpaid distillate production
  - $5 million lost revenue (equipment confiscated for 5 months)
- **SND's Position:** Delta responsible for compliance as licensee; SND only contracted to produce raw cannabis oil
- **Delta's Position:** SND's product caused the compliance failure
- **Attorney for SND:** Joy Primoli
- **Status:** Proceeding through Franklin County court; arbitration scheduled

### Blame Attribution
In legal filings, Sparks directs blame at Josh Corson:
- Claims Corson "found the supply for the distillate"
- Corson signed the contracts
- Claims Delta leadership assured him regulators approved the process
- SND suit states: "The reality is that (the state) never gave assurances of regulatory compliance"
